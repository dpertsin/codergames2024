### What is CoderGames?

CoderGames is an online individual coding competition where you solve one task each day, from Monday to Friday, gain points for correct answers as well as your speed, and win cool prizes! The tasks were created by developers from Deutsche Telekom around Europe, with contributing colleagues from Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary, Spain, and Greece. There is a lot to look forward to!
